This code implements a Discord bot that automates certain actions on a Discord server.
 The bot is able to:

    Show a warning about potentially destructive actions it can perform.
    Delete all existing channels on the server.
    Create new text channels.
    Modify the server name.
    Create roles.

When the bot is launched, it displays a warning and asks the user to type 'proceed' 
to continue or 'exit' to quit. If the user continues, the bot presents different options 
in the form of numbered questions. The user can choose one of these options by entering 
the corresponding number.

Options include deleting existing channels, creating new channels, changing the server 
name, and creating roles. For some options, the bot may ask the user to provide additional information, such as the name of the channels to create or the number of roles to create.

The bot uses the Discord API to interact with the server and perform actions requested 
by the user. However, it is important to note that this bot can perform potentially 
destructive actions, such as deleting channels and changing the server name. Therefore, 
it should be used with caution and only on authorized servers.
